# Neural Network in C++

This repository contains a neural network implementation in C++ from scratch. The goal is to understand the fundamental concepts of neural networks and how they can be implemented without relying on external libraries.

## Features

- **Custom Implementation**: Built from the ground up using C++.
- **Educational Focus**: Demonstrates how neural networks work internally.
- **Scalable Design**: Modular structure for easy expansion and experimentation.

## Learning Resources

This implementation is inspired by the tutorial on **YouTube**:  
[**Neural Network in C++ from Scratch**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntKn5TPHHAk&t=945s) by *The Cherno*.

Special thanks to this excellent resource for providing a clear and concise explanation of the underlying concepts!
